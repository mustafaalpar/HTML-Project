# HTML-Project
Web Design Class Project
Description
The repository includes a project I created for a Web Design class during my freshman year at university. The project was an early exercise in learning the basics of HTML and web development.

Project Context
At the time, I was just beginning to learn HTML. While the interface and design may not be highly polished, this project reflects my early enthusiasm and enjoyment in learning web development.
